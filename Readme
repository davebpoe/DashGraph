Dash Graph

Inspired by Dygraphs to be a rapid Javascript plotting library, DasphGraph is
designed to make plotting of various types very fast.  In particular it supports
multiple datasets with various x-axes, as well as filters which are designed
to change the color of the plot at specific locations.

There are currently many important missing features, and bugs with the plot such
that it is not useful for deployment at this time.
